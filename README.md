# Unicode Grantha typeface

This is a project to create a Unicode-compliant Grantha typeface based on the proposed [Unicode 7.0](http://www.unicode.org/versions/beta-7.0.0.html) [encoding](http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n4135.pdf) in the U+11300 SMP block. Tested on OSX 10.10 and Windows 10.

## How to Use

### On OSX

Simply download the OSX font file from [releases](https://github.com/deepestblue/Sampradaya/releases/) and drop it into /Library/Fonts/ (to install system-wide) or ~/Library/Fonts/ (to install at user-scope). You may need to restart your application (or logout/login) for the font to be usable. If you're looking to input Grantha text, I highly recommend [Lipika](https://github.com/ratreya/Lipika_IME) with the [Ksharanam key-map for Grantha](https://bitbucket.org/OorNaattaan/keymap/src).

### On Windows

Simply download the Windows font file from [releases](https://github.com/deepestblue/Sampradaya/releases/), click the secondary mouse button, and choose `Install` or `Install for all users`.
