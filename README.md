# Unicode Grantha typeface

This is a project to create a Unicode-compliant Grantha typeface based on the [Unicode 7.0.0](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/) [encoding](http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n4135.pdf) in the U+11300 SMP block. It is tested on OSX 10.10+ and Windows 10.

## How to Use

### On Windows
