This is a project to create a Unicode-compliant Grantha font based on the proposed Unicode encoding in the U+11300 SMP block, according to the provisional encoding in 
http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n4135.pdf

The typeface has the following ligature look-up sub-tables:
* Akhanda forms
* Post-glyph half-repha form
* Pre-composed stacked forms
* Infra-baseline half-form stacks of akhanda forms
* Infra-baseline half-form stacks of other consonants
* Post-forms of conjunct-ya and conjunct-repha

# TODO:
* Add terminal forms of ta, na and ma
* Fix ttha akhanda-ligature
* Add glyph for Rw vowel combining mark
* Add combining markers for O and au
* Add rearrangement for post-glyph pre-repha form
