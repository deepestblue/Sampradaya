# Unicode Grantha typeface

This is a project to create a Unicode-compliant Grantha typeface based on [Unicode 7.0.0](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/) [encoding](http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n4135.pdf) in the U+11300 SMP block. It is tested on OSX 10.10+ and Windows 10.

## How to Use

### On OSX

Download the OSX font file from [releases](https://github.com/deepestblue/Sampradaya/releases/) and drop the downloaded file into /Library/Fonts/ (to install system-wide) or ~/Library/Fonts/ (to install at user-scope). You may need to restart your application (or logout/login) for the font to be usable.

### On Windows

Download the Windows font file from [releases](https://github.com/deepestblue/Sampradaya/releases/), click the secondary mouse button on the downloaded file, and choose `Install` or `Install for all users` as appropriate.
